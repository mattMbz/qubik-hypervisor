Qubik is a small, useful project for turning your Linux server into a hypervisor and running virtual machines. Written in bash scripting for controlling virtual machines and Django for providing the user with a remote management web application. This project incorporates open source virtualization technologies such as libvirt, qemu, and KVM. It's been inspired by other cloud hypervisors like Digital Ocean.
