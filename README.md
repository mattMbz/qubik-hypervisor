[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.8-blue.svg)](https://semver.org)

Qubik is a project for turning your Linux server into a hypervisor and running virtual machines. Written in bash scripting for controlling virtual machines and Django framework for providing the user with a remote management web application. This project incorporates open source virtualization technologies such as libvirt, qemu, and KVM. It's been inspired by other cloud hypervisors like Digital Ocean.

## Features
- Turn your Linux server into a Hypervisor and manage virtual machines from your browser.
- Create, run, stop and delete virtual machine from your web browser.
- Run Debian and Alpine Linux virtual machines from the Qubik web hypervisor.
- Resources monitoring for the hypervisor like as CPU, Memory and Disks usage.
- Resources monitoring for vm like as CPU, Memory and Disks usage.
- Automatic application deployment.
- At the moment, new functionalities are creating ðŸš€ ...

## Architecture

The architecture of this hypervisor is configured in different layers. It starts with an application layer where a frontend connects with a backend. Then, the layers below the backend/Django correspond to the management of virtual machines and some automation tasks for their configuration.
